Â Â Â  <p>
Over the past year, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to grow in ways I never expected through the Jreid Indeed program. What started as an interest in real estate quickly turned into a deep dive into IT, coding, and professional development.

Through hands-on projects like coding in Minecraft and building personal websites with HTML and CSS, I discovered a passion for tech and teamwork. I also gained valuable skills in Microsoft 365, finance, and career readinessâ€”including creating a polished LinkedIn profile and connecting with industry professionals, including gamers and tech experts.

Most importantly, I found a supportive community thatâ€™s helped shape my goals and confidence. Iâ€™m excited to keep learning, growing, and building a future in tech.Â Â Â  </p>

Â Â Â  <h2>Skills</h2>
Â Â Â  <p>At The Jreid Indeed IT camp, I learned how to build my own website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I used HTML to create the structure of my site, CSS to style it and make it look good, and JavaScript to add interactive features like buttons and animations. These skills helped me turn a basic webpage into something fun, creative, and personalized.

Â  <div id="projects" class="tab-content">
Â Â Â  <h2>Projects</h2>
Â Â Â  <p>Over the past two years at IT camp, Iâ€™ve worked on creative and technical projects that helped me grow as a team player and a problem solver. Last year, I collaborated with a group to design a custom Minecraft world, coding pixel art like the Chiefs and Bulls logos. This year, Iâ€™ve been building my own website, creating a LinkedIn profile, and learning CPR and cardiac arrest response through AHA. These experiences have taught me valuable skills in coding, design, teamwork, and real-world readiness.
